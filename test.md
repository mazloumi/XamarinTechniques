|Technique|What is it?|Location|Mainly|XAML Syntax|Thoughts|Lines of Code in C#|Available|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Attached Property**|Public Class with public static readonly`BindableProperty`, Getter and Setter and possibly`PropertyChanged` delegate |Shared project|C#|`<Entry local:MyClass.MyProperty="Some Value"/>`|Useful for extending View including wrapping other techniques listed here. Brevity of XAML.|39|Any XAML element|
|**Behavior**|Sub class of `Behavior<T>` with overrides for `OnAttachedTo` and `OnDetachingFrom`|Shared project|C#|`<Entry><Entry.Behaviors><local:MyBehavior /></Entry.Behaviors></Entry>`|Useful for extending the View|23|`VisualElement.Behaviors`|
|**Effect**|Sub class of `RoutingEffect` and platform-specific sub classes of `PlatformEffect` with overrides for `OnAttached`, `OnDetached` and possibly `OnElementPropertyChanged`|Shared project and platform-specific projects|C#|`<Entry><Entry.Effects><local:MyEffect /></Entry.Effects></Entry>`|Access to native control, events and properties|67|`Element.Effects`|
|**Event handler**|View with a delegate for an event|Shared project Code Behind|C#|`<Entry Focused="Entry_Focused" />`|Usage limited to specific view used in the XAML|5|All Events available for a view|
|**Property Trigger**|`Trigger` for specific `Property` and `Value` of a `TargetType` and `Setter` elements to change specific properties of the target type|Shared project|XAML|`<Entry><Entry.Triggers><Trigger Property="IsFocused" Value="True"><Setter Property="BackgroundColor" Value="Yellow"/></Trigger></Entry.Triggers></Entry>`|Scope limited but effective.|0|`VisualElement.Triggers` and `Style.Triggers`|
|**Renderer**|Optional sub class of a visual element and platform-specific sub classes of the element's renderer class with override of `OnElementChanged` method evaluating `OldElement` and `NewElement` member of `ElementChangedEventArgs<T>`|Platform-specific projects|C#|`<local:MyControl/>`|Full access to the native control used even allowing it to be replaced|72|40 renderer base classes|
|**Tap Gesture Recognizer**|`TapGestureRecognizer` with `Tapped` delegate triggered after `NumberOfTapsRequired`|Shared project|XAML|`<Entry><Entry.GestureRecognizers><TapGestureRecognizer Tapped="Entry_Focused" NumberOfTapsRequired="1" /></Entry.GestureRecognizers></Entry>`|Listen to user interaction and extend behavior. Event handler can be in the Code Behind or a command in the view model.|5|`View.GestureRecognizers`|
